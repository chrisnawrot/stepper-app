# Stepper App

This a small application written in Elm that shows how the following features might be implemented in a more serious applicaton:

* i18n
* Unit-testing
* Validation
* Routing
* I/O

Largely a work-in-progress; not all bullets complete. The application was bootstrapped with [Create-Elm-App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
