# Stepper App

This a small application written in Elm that shows how the following features might be implemented in a more serious applicaton:

* i18n
* Unit-testing
* Validation
* Routing
* I/O
* Organzing code [the suggested Elm-way](https://guide.elm-lang.org/webapps/structure.html)

Largely a work-in-progress; not all bullets complete. The application was bootstrapped with [Create-Elm-App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
